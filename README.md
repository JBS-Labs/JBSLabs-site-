# JBS Labs

Landing page for JBS Labs — Thoughtful Apps. Practical Tools. Human-Centred Design.

## GitHub Pages

This repo is set up to be published as a GitHub Page.

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g. `jbs-labs` or `mind-mendr`).
2. Push this folder's contents to the repo (either the whole folder so the repo root contains `index.html` and `MIND MENDR GITHUB PAGE_files/`, or only the contents so those files are at the root).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages** → under "Build and deployment", set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch".
4. Choose the branch (e.g. `main`) and folder **/ (root)**. Save.
5. After a minute or two, the site will be at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

Use **index.html** as the entry point so the root URL loads correctly.

## Structure

- `index.html` — Main page (use this for GitHub Pages).
- `MIND MENDR GITHUB PAGE_files/` — CSS, JS, and images (including `Images/` with logos and assets).
